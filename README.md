# Smart-Voting-System
#The basic idea of this project is to create an electronic voting machine that will help to eradicate defrauding of the manual voting systems and prior versions of electronic voting. The thesis looks into and proposes a system that includes multiple layers of verifications to ensure the reliability of the device. With the inclusion of biometric fingerprint sensor, each voter is entered into the system only after being recognized and checked with the given database of enlisted voters. Once the corresponding fingerprint is matched with the information provided, the voter will be allowed to proceed to choose their preferred candidate from the touch screen. The final vote is then displayed onto a screen for the satisfaction of voters and the number of votes for each voter. The proposed project displays transparency and also carries the feature of being autonomous during operation.
